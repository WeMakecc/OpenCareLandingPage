- ### [INPE](http://inpe.opencare.cc/)
- is a device designed as a wearable that calls the caregiver and sends sms with coordinates, in order for them to come and help the person who accidentally fell. Inspired by true stories, InPe, serves different needs such as elderly parents living by themselves, or helping a caregiver in a community center. It’s an open source solution which can be customised with or without the support of a community makerspace depending on the skills of the stakeholder. The activity not only achieved the publication of an accessible prototype but created an environment in which citizens, patients and care-givers felt of taking control of tools and technologies which could scale their contribution to a whole new community of care (2016)

- ### [OPEN RAMPETTE](http://rampette.opencare.cc/)
- is a social impact project developed to gather on the same path milanese citizens, municipality and shop owners to identify a tangible solution to the stagnating issue of accessibility in public spaces by people that require the use of a wheelchair. The activity not only achieved the becoming transparent of a process of finding a solution but changed the perception and closeness of all the stakeholders involved, de facto making it a community (2017)

- ### [MAKER IN RESIDENCE](/makerinresidence)
- was a special residency program taking place at WeMake which provided support, assistance and acceleration to 6 teams of Makers (16 people directly involved from all over the world) – who were interested in developing / validating / iterating an existing open source project in the health and care field. The output of opencare Maker In Residence allowed to multiply the prototyping effort testing the role of Fablab as accelerating platform of new projects (2017).

  - ### [ALLERGOKI](http://allergoki.opencare.cc/)
  -  is platform and a Kit for Restaurateurs, consisting of a set of tools to enhance the customer suffering from food allergies’ experience inside the restaurant.

  - ### [BREATHING GAMES](http://breathinggames.opencare.cc/)
  - creates educational and therapeutic games, devices to measure the breath and distributed data systems to inform public health practices, and policies.

  - ### [REHUB](http://rehub.opencare.cc/)
  - is an online platform and open source kit that allows the monitoring of fingers and hand movement for athletes, rehabilitation patients and music instrument students that needs a certain and digital data to monitor the exercise.

  - ### [VOICE INSTRUMENTS](http://voiceinstruments.opencare.cc/)
  - is an open source interface designed for speaking numeric values and service messages to meet the needs of blind citizens or people who are unable to read or in contexts where it is uncomfortable to use the display to read values on a monitor.

- ### [MAKER PLAYBOOK](http://makerplaybook.opencare.cc/)
- The whole process was supported by the Maker Playbook “Co-designing care services: a practical guide” which shares to a wider public the how-to of the engagement processes, the co- design sessions, the prototyping and sharing documentation approach.

- ### [GRAPHRYDER](http://graphryder.opencare.cc)
- is a fully interactive prototype dashboard designed in the context of opencare for Semantic Social Network Analysis. GraphRyder builds a Semantic Social Network, on the basis of online community conversations for which an ethnographic coding was performed. Analysing the SSN and using the result of such analysis as intelligence to inform the action of the community management team, it allows users to select a group of ethnographic codes and visualise the social network around those codes. Conversely, it allows to select a group of users and see what they have been discussing.
