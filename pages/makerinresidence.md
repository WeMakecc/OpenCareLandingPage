# Maker In Residence

The opencare Maker in Residence is the first edition of a special residency programme organized by WeMake, as part of the opencare European project. It provides support, assistance, funding and acceleration to Makers – from all over the world – who are interested in developing / validating / iterating an open source project in the health and care field.

The opencare Maker in Residence will take place from April to July 2017 (dates will be scheduled according to applicants’ availability).

Residents can live and work on-site for a period of time that may vary from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 8 weeks, providing an opportunity for intense collaboration, creativity, and learning to improve their project.
